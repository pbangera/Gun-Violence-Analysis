In order to do so we created a new panda dataframe that condidted of columns - Year, States, and Frequency/count of gun violence crimes. This dataframe allowed us to present total gun violence crimes in each state in each year in a very concise manner. Later we grouped the data frame by the name of the state and plotted it on the graph."
